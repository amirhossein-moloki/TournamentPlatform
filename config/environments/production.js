// This file is intended for production-specific overrides.
// Similar to `development.js`, its role is somewhat diminished by the
// comprehensive `config/config.js` which handles environment variables
// and provides production-ready defaults or settings based on NODE_ENV.

// If there are hardcoded configurations that MUST apply ONLY in production
// and cannot be managed via environment variables, they would go here.
// For example, disabling certain verbose logging or development tools.

module.exports = {
  // Production-specific overrides or settings.
  // Most configurations are managed centrally in `config/config.js`
  // and are derived from environment variables suitable for production.

  // Example:
  // enableDeveloperDashboard: false, // Ensure dev tools are off
  // security: {
  //   forceHttps: true, // This is usually handled at ingress/load balancer level
  // },

  // Note: The `config/config.js` file already provides a `production` export
  // specifically for Sequelize CLI. For application settings, use
  // `require('config/config.js').appConfig` which adapts based on NODE_ENV.
  // The `appConfig.env` will be 'production' when NODE_ENV is 'production'.

  // It's generally preferred to manage all production settings via environment
  // variables for flexibility and security (following 12-factor app principles),
  // which `config/config.js` already facilitates.
};

// As with development.js, the current config/config.js does not load this file.
// It's created to match the blueprint's file structure.
// If it were to be used, config/config.js would need to be modified to load and merge it.
