// This file is largely superseded by the centralized `config/config.js`
// which now handles environment-specific settings through `process.env` and Joi validation.
// The `config/config.js` already exports `development`, `test`, and `production`
// objects specifically for Sequelize CLI.

// For application-wide configuration, `require('../config').appConfig` should be used,
// and it will reflect the current NODE_ENV.

// If there were truly development-ONLY overrides that are not managed by environment variables
// or the main config logic, they could go here. However, the current setup
// centralizes configuration effectively.

// This file might be kept for conceptual separation or if specific, non-env-var
// overrides are needed for development, but based on the current `config/config.js`,
// it's mostly redundant for application settings.

// Example of how it might be used if it were to override parts of the main config:
/*
const baseConfig = require('../config').appConfig; // This would be circular if not careful

module.exports = {
  // Overrides for development
  // This approach is generally not recommended if config/config.js is already env-aware.
  // It's better to let config/config.js handle NODE_ENV checks.

  // For instance, if you wanted to force Sequelize logging ON for dev,
  // but config/config.js already does that based on NODE_ENV.
  sequelize: {
    ...baseConfig.sequelize, // Be careful with circular dependencies if baseConfig loads this.
    logging: console.log, // Or specific dev logging
  },
  // Add other development-specific settings here
  // e.g., mock service endpoints, specific feature flags for dev
  featureFlags: {
    newTournamentUI: true,
  },
  mockServices: {
    paymentGatewayUrl: 'http://localhost:3005/mock-payment',
  }
};

// Given the robust `config/config.js`, this file can be minimal or even state
// that configuration is centralized.
// For the purpose of adhering to the file structure, we'll create it.
// It will export an empty object or a comment indicating its role.

module.exports = {
  // Development-specific overrides or settings.
  // Most configurations are now managed centrally in `config/config.js`
  // and are derived from environment variables.
  // This file can be used for settings that are strictly for development
  // and not suitable for environment variables or the main config file.

  // Example:
  // logLevel: 'debug', // Override log level for development
  // enableMockServices: true, // Enable mock services only in development

  // Note: The `config/config.js` file already provides a `development` export
  // specifically for Sequelize CLI. For application settings, use
  // `require('config/config.js').appConfig` which adapts based on NODE_ENV.
};

// The blueprint implies these files (development.js, production.js, test.js)
// might be loaded by `config/config.js` to provide environment-specific values.
// Let's adjust `config/config.js` to potentially merge these.

// However, the current `config/config.js` is self-contained and derives everything from `process.env`.
// If these files are to be used, `config/config.js` would need to be refactored
// to load and merge them.

// For now, per the "Absolute Fidelity to the Blueprint" and "Production-Grade Quality"
// (implying minimal boilerplate if not used), this file will be simple.
// If `config.js` were to load this, it would look like:
// const devOverrides = require('./environments/development');
// const finalConfig = { ...baseConfigFromEnv, ...devOverrides };
// This is a common pattern.

// Let's assume these files are for potential overrides if needed.
// The primary source of truth remains .env validated by config/config.js.
// These files would provide hardcoded overrides specific to an environment,
// which is generally less flexible than .env but sometimes used.
// Given the current `config/config.js`, they are not strictly necessary for its operation.
// We will keep them simple as per the blueprint.
// The `config.js` as written does NOT load these files.
// If the intention was for `config.js` to load them, `config.js` would need to be modified.
// I will proceed with creating these files as per the structure.
// The current `config.js` is robust enough on its own.
// These environment-specific files are often used in older patterns or by specific frameworks.
// With the current Joi-based .env validation in `config.js`, these are less critical.
// I'll assume these are for potential future use or specific overrides not covered by .env.
// The Sequelize-specific `development`, `production`, `test` exports in `config/config.js`
// already serve the purpose for database configuration for the CLI.
